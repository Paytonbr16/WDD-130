<h2>About me:</h2>
    <p>I am a second semester freshman at Brigham Young University with a Major in Computer Information Technology, emphasizing in cybersecurity. I hope to work for the governmenet and to help our country in cyberdefense.<p>
    <p>I'm here at BYUI because it's COLD and I love it! I really do not like the heat of Las Vegas, where I'm from. While I'm here, I am also working for the school in event services as an A/V Basic Services Technician.</p>
<h3>Hobbies:</h3>
    <p>- I love to study LDS Church doctrine and history, and also spend time studying biblical scholarship and seeing how the two complement each other. Every day I will typically take around 30 minutes to an hour studying various topics I'm unfamiliar with. It's super fun, and it strengthens my testimony a lot!!!</p>
    <p>- My favorite sport is Archery, but I also like to shoot guns and go bowling. I tried a lot of sports as a kid (soccer, baseball, basketball, tennis) but none of them ever stuck with me. Turns out I just like shooting things, or throwing 11-pound balls for fun!</p>
    <p>- From my time on my school broadcast team in middle school and high school, I've loved to edit videos in spare time to make funny content for myself and friends.</p>
    <p>- I also like to listen to music, particularly heavy metal or punk rock. Lincoln Park is great!</p>
