                    <p>Welcome to the questions page! This faith is a faith of open and encouraged learning. 
                        We have many tools available to us to learn the mysteries of God. 
                        Elder Neal A. Maxwell stated in a discourse that “Though argument does not create conviction, the lack of it destroys belief. What seems to be proved may not [necessarily] be embraced; but what no one shows the ability to defend is quickly abandoned. Rational argument does not create belief, but it maintains a climate in which belief may flourish.” 
                        Some products of a developed theology with a complex history include questions we have. 
                        These can apply to any realm of topics in the Church, be it theological, historical, cultural, or otherwise.</p>
                        A lot of these questions are hard to answer completely because we don't have all of the answers. 
                        Fortunately, most of these questions have all been tackled before by scholars and productive readers, even writing extensively on them at a scholarly level. 
                        Although, some arguments are naturally better than others, and we learn a lot with time. 
                        Many websites are kept up for this purpose as new information comes out, addressing these problems directly with full transparency on the problems. 
                        On this page you can find a list of websites and resources categorized by topic in order to find the best place and the most qualified people to answer your tough questions.
