      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to lds argumentum, a site designed as  a resource for those who want more effective study of LDS Church History and Doctrine. A correct understanding leads to wiser actions, greater confidence, and increased faith in God. Here, you can find many sites and resources that facilitate deeper understandings of the scriptures and also the events in LDS Church History that got us to where we are today. 

It's stated in Doctrine and Covenants section 93 verse 36 that "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth." This website is designed so that anyone can have access to the many options for study and apologetics that help facilitate faith in God and assist members of the LDS church with questions. Depending on what you want, the website is divided into two sections: Study Resources, and Questions. Feel free to visit each one depending on your needs!

      <h3>Study Resources</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to the Study Resources page! Here you can find options for studying the scriptures or looking at source materials from church history. In 1832, the early saints were advised: “And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:118). If you lack faith, seek it! Reading and studying the scriptures consistently is the best way to better understand how God works, and knowing what happened in history is a great way to understand the faith those who paved the way for us. 

Education is a very important part of life here on earth. People go through school and college all to learn more about the world, and perhaps specialize in something in particular. The spiritual and religious aspect of this is equally important. People cannot receive personal revelation in a vacuum, meaning they must gain knowledge of spiritual things if they expect to be guided by God in this life. Studying the scriptures is the primary way to do so, allowing people to learn from the stories that have inspired millions, gain insights from religious discourse, and ultimately figure out what it is that they can change in their lives to align themselves with what is righteous. 

Understanding the historical context correctly can help us relate more to the people who wrote the scriptures, and those who are described within. Much of reading the scriptures involves either interpretation, or understanding what interpretation the author was attempting to make in the first place. To do this, context is key. The exact same is true of Church history. Understanding the perspectives, day-to-day lives, and vocabulary is fundamental to understand what it is that they are conveying to the people who they spoke to. 

Familiarize yourself with the resources below for studying the scriptures. It’s divided in two columns: one for church history, and the other for scripture study.

      <h3>Questions</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to the questions page! This faith is a faith of open and encouraged learning. We have many tools available to us to learn the mysteries of God. Elder Neal A. Maxwell stated in a discourse that “Though argument does not create conviction, the lack of it destroys belief. What seems to be proved may not [necessarily] be embraced; but what no one shows the ability to defend is quickly abandoned. Rational argument does not create belief, but it maintains a climate in which belief may flourish.” 

Some products of a developed theology with a complex history include questions we have. These can apply to any realm of topics in the Church, be it theological, historical, cultural, or otherwise. A lot of these questions are hard to answer completely because we don’t have all of the answers. Fortunately, most of these questions have all been tackled before by scholars and productive readers, even writing extensively on them at a scholarly level. 

Although, some arguments are naturally better than others, and we learn a lot with time. Many websites are kept up for this purpose as new information comes out, addressing these problems directly with full transparency on the problems. On this page you can find a list of websites and resources categorized by topic in order to find the best place and the most qualified people to answer your tough questions.
