                <p>Welcome to the Study Resources page! Here you can find options for studying the scriptures or looking at source materials from church history.
                    In 1832, the early saints were advised: “And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:118).
                    If you lack faith, seek it! Reading and studying the scriptures consistently is the best way to better understand how God works, and knowing what happened in history is a great way to understand the faith those who paved the way for us.
                    Education is a very important part of life here on earth. People go through school and college all to learn more about the world, and perhaps specialize in something in particular.
                    The spiritual and religious aspect of this is equally important. </p>
                    People cannot receive personal revelation in a vacuum, meaning they must gain knowledge of spiritual things if they expect to be guided by God in this life. 
                    Studying the scriptures is the primary way to do so, allowing people to learn from the stories that have inspired millions, gain insights from religious discourse, and ultimately figure out what it is that they can change in their lives to align themselves with what is righteous. 
                    Understanding the historical context correctly can help us relate more to the people who wrote the scriptures, and those who are described within. 
                    Much of reading the scriptures involves either interpretation, or understanding what interpretation the author was attempting to make in the first place. 
                    To do this, context is key. The exact same is true of Church history.
                    Understanding the perspectives, day-to-day lives, and vocabulary is fundamental to understand what it is that they are conveying to the people who they spoke to.
                    Familiarize yourself with the resources below for studying the scriptures. 
                    It's divided in two columns: one for church history, and the other for scripture study.</p>

                        <h2>LDS Library:</h2>
                        <p>All of the standard works can be accessed here along with the study helps. Additionally, resources such as Come Follow Me, church history topics, and other study materials can be accessed on the site.</p>

                    <div class="sbox2">
                        <a href="https://www.logos.com/"><img class="logoswl" src="images/logos-l.jpg" alt="logos-logo"></a>
                        <h2>Logos:</h2>
                        <p>This is a non-lds resource for studying the Bible. It's very useful for various passage and word guides. Read from many different translations for comparison, and study the meaning and usages of words in the Biblical texts.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="sbox3">
                        <a href="https://thebible.org/gt/index"><img class="parallelwl" src="images/parallelpwl.jpg" alt="parallelp-logo"></a>
                        <h2>Parallel Plus:</h2>
                        <p>This is a resource similar to Logos, but minus the commentary and wide vareity of options. If you just want the Hebrew/Greek and alternate translations to study, this website is perfect.</p>

                        <h2>The Joseph Smith Papers:</h2>
                        <p>This is the definitive resource for source documents surrounding the life of Joseph Smith. If you want to study a time in Joseph Smith's life that is close to one of the revelations, or just know the historical perspectives better, this is the place to go.</p>

                        <h2>The Scripture Citation Index:</h2>
                        <p>Put together by Stephen W. Liddle and Richard C. Galbraith, this is a fantastic way to see what general authorities of the LDS church have said in reference to all scriptures. It is also incredibly useful as a way to study the Scriptural Teachings of The Prophet Joseph Smith and also the Journal of Discourses (superficially).</p>
