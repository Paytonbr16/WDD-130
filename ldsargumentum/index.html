                    <h2>Welcome to LDS Argumentum</h2>
                    <p>This is a site designed as  a resource for those who want more effective study of LDS Church History and Doctrine. A correct understanding leads to wiser actions, greater confidence, and increased faith in God. Here, you can find many sites and resources that facilitate deeper understandings of the scriptures and also the events in LDS Church History that got us to where we are today. 

                        It's stated in Doctrine and Covenants section 93 verse 36 that "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth." This website is designed so that anyone can have access to the many options for study and apologetics that help facilitate faith in God and assist members of the LDS church with questions. Depending on what you want, the website is divided into two sections: Study Resources, and Questions. Feel free to visit each one depending on your needs!
